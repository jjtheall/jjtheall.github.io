### John "Jack" Theall
#### Boston, MA | Currently located in Binghamton, NY


## Who am I?

I am a computer science and mathematics undergraduate student studying at Quinnipiac University. I am an incredibly
driven person and I dedicated to learning as much as I can about computing so
that I can achieve a level of professionalism in this field that will allow
me to improve people's lives worldwide. I am expected to graduate with a Bachelor of Science in May 2023.

I am a software engineer at Collins Aerospace, where I contribute to the design and development of avionics simulation
and computer systems in Binghamton, NY. I am an incredibly driven individual, dedicated to expanding my knowledge of
computing and achieving a level of professionalism that allows me to create various technologies that improve people's lives worldwide.
I am also a skiing fanatic, an amateur musician, and a video game nerd.  

## Why Computer Science?

With technology as powerful as it is in today's world, I believe that an understanding of computer science
is the most powerful tool humans have to create positive change. I, along with the majority of my family,
am a type one diabetic and rely on insulin pump technology daily to survive. Living with this disease
has been eye-opening to the seemingly limitless power of improving technology. I draw motivation from the idea that
in becoming a computing professional, I will have the knowledge and expertise required to similarly improve people's qualiy of life.
