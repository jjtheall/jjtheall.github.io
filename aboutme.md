# About Me

![Headshot](./assets/images/Theall_Headshot.jpg)

### John "Jack" Theall
#### Boston, MA | Currently located in Binghamton, NY


## Who am I?

I am a software engineer at Collins Aerospace, where I contribute to the design and development of avionics simulation
and computer systems in Binghamton, NY. I am an incredibly driven individual, dedicated to expanding my knowledge of
computing and achieving a level of professionalism that allows me to create various technologies that improve people's lives worldwide.
I am also a skiing fanatic, an amateur musician, and a video game nerd.  

## Why Computer Science?

With technology as powerful as it is in today's world, I believe that an understanding of computer science
is the most powerful tool humans have to create positive change. I, along with the majority of my family,
am a type one diabetic and rely on insulin pump technology daily to survive. Living with this disease
has been eye-opening to the seemingly limitless power of improving technology. I draw motivation from the idea that
in becoming a computing professional, I will have the knowledge and expertise required to similarly improve people's quality of life.

## Hobbies & Interests

#### Skiing
My parents essentially threw me on skis the second I could walk, and I have been in love with the sport ever since.
I have several years of alpine racing experience, and have recently started to experiment with freestyle which has been a blast.
#### Music
Over the course of my life, I have dedicated many years to learning a variety of instruments, including piano, clarinet, 
and most recently, the electric bass. I value having a creative outlet like this, and find that coming home from a long day
to make random bits of music brings me joy and improves my overall mental well-being.

#### Obligatory Pet Section

This is my bengal cat named Barley. She'll either give you love & cuddles, or claws & teeth depending on her mood. No in-between.
