# About Me
![Headshot](./assets/images/Theall_Headshot.jpg)
### John "Jack" Theall
#### Boston, MA


## Who am I?
I am a computer science and mathematics undergraduate student studying Quinnipiac University. I am an incredibly
driven person and I dedicated to learning as much as I can about computing so
that I can achieve a level of professionalism in this field that will allow
me to improve people's lives worldwide. I am expected to graduate with a Bachelor of Science in May 2023.

## Why Computer Science?
With technology as powerful as it is in today's world, I believe that an understanding of computer science
is the most powerful tool humans have to create positive change. I, along with the majority of my family,
am type one diabetic and rely on insulin pump technology daily to survive. Living with this disease
has been eye-opening to the seemingly limitless power of improving technology. I draw motivation from the idea that
once I have become a computing professional, I will have the knowledge and expertise required to perfect the software behind
the artificial pancreas, effectively providing a technological solution to the disease.

## Current Experience
I have accepted an offer and plan to work an internship at Infosys as part of a software development team for the Summer '22.
